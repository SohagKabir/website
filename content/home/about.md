I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.bradford.ac.uk/ei/computer-science/) at the University of Bradford.  I am also an Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy (AFHEA). From February 2017 until September 2019, I was a research associate in the Dependable Intelligent Systems research group at the University of Hull. I received my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Hull in 2016.

I am interested in Safety and Reliability Assessment of Cyber Physical Autonomous Systems.<!---safety critical systems, fault propagation studies within system architectures and probabilistic risk assessment of dynamic systems in the condition of uncertainty.--> Currently, I am working on concepts for dealing with uncertainty and limited observability of data in safety assessment and certification of autonomous systems such as driverless cars.

**For Prospective PhD Students:**
Currently, I am looking for PhD students to perform high quality research in the area of dependability assessment of cyber physical systems (CPS). If you are  enthusiastic and interested in carrying out research in this area, please take a look at some of my advertised projects on [IoT Safety](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/security-aware-safety-monitoring-of-iot-enabled-smart-environment/?p117745), [Safety Assurance of Safety-Critical Autonomous Systems](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/edge-intelligence-for-safety-assurance-of-time-critical-cyber-physical-systems/?p114910), [Probabilistic Analysis of CPS](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/a-model-driven-bayesian-approach-for-probabilistic-analysis-of-cyber-physical-systems/?p87045), [Reliability Modelling of Autonomous Systems](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/reliability-modelling-of-complex-autonomous-systems/?p117730), and [Machine learning for Autonomous and Interconnected Vehicles](https://www.findaphd.com/phds/project/machine-learning-for-autonomous-and-interconnected-vehicles/?p117720). If any of these projects interest you, do not hesitate to contact me.   <!---Over the years, I have had the chance to expose myself to different tools and techniques such as Fault Tree Analysis, Dynamic Fault Trees, HiP-HOPS, FMEAs, MATLAB/Simulink, genetic algorithms, Tabu search, Markov Chains, Bayesian Networks, Stochastic Petri Nets, and State Machines.-->
