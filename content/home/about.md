I am a lecturer in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.bradford.ac.uk/ei/computer-science/) at the University of Bradford. From February 2017 until September 2019, I was a research associate in the Dependable Intelligent Systems research group in the School of Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Hull. I received my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Hull in 2016 under the supervision of Dr Martin Walker.

I am particularly interested in Model-based Safety Assessment (MBSA) of safety critical systems, fault propagation studies within system architectures and probabilistic risk assessment of dynamic systems in the condition of uncertainty. At present, I am working on concepts for dealing with uncertainty and limited observability of data in safety assessment and certification of autonomous systems such as driverless cars. Over the years, I have had the chance to expose myself to different tools and techniques such as Fault Tree Analysis, Dynamic Fault Trees, [HiP-HOPS](http://www.hip-hops.eu/), FMEAs, MATLAB/Simulink, genetic algorithms, Tabu search, Markov Chains, Bayesian Networks, Stochastic Petri Nets, and State Machines.
