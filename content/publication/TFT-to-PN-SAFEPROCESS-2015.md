abstract = "Using classical combinatorial fault trees, analysts are able to assess the effects of combinations of failures on system behaviour but are unable to capture sequence dependent dynamic behaviour. Pandora introduces temporal gates and temporal laws to fault trees to allow sequence-dependent dynamic analysis of events. Pandora can be easily integrated in model-based design and analysis techniques; however, the combinatorial quantification techniques used to solve classical fault trees cannot be applied to temporal fault trees. Temporal fault trees capture state and therefore require a state space solution for quantification of probability. In this paper, we identify Petri Nets as a possible framework for quantifying temporal trees. We describe how Pandora fault trees can be mapped to Petri Nets for dynamic dependability analysis and demonstrate the process on a fault tolerant fuel distribution system model."
