abstract = "Safety and reliability are two important aspects of dependability that are needed to be rigorously evaluated throughout the development life-cycle of a system. Over the years, several methodologies have been developed for the analysis of failure behaviour of systems. Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) is one of the well-established and widely used methods for safety and reliability engineering of systems. Fault tree, in its classical static form, is inadequate for modelling dynamic interactions between components and is unable to include temporal and statistical dependencies in the model. Several attempts have been made to alleviate the aforementioned limitations of static fault trees (SFT). Dynamic Fault Trees (DFT) were introduced to enhance the modelling power of its static counterpart. In DFT, the expressiveness of fault tree was improved by introducing new dynamic gates. While the introduction of the dynamic gates helps to overcome many limitations of SFT and allow to analyse a wide-range of complex systems, it brings some overhead with it. One such overhead is that the existing combinatorial approaches used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of SFTs are no longer applicable to DFTs. This leads to several successful attempts for developing new approaches for DFT analysis. The methodologies used so far for DFT analysis include, but not limited to, algebraic solution, Markov models, Petri Nets, Bayesian Networks, and Monte Carlo simulation. To illustrate the usefulness of modelling capability of DFTs, many benchmark studies have been performed in different industries. Moreover, software tools are developed to aid in the DFT analysis process. Firstly, in this chapter, we provided a brief description of the DFT methodology. Secondly, this chapter reviews a number of prominent DFT analysis techniques such as Markov chains, Petri Nets, Bayesian networks, algebraic approach; and provides insight into their working mechanism, applicability, strengths, and challenges. These reviewed techniques covered both qualitative and quantitative analysis of DFTs. Thirdly, we discussed the emerging trends on machine learning based approaches to DFT analysis. Fourthly, the research performed for sensitivity analysis in DFTs have been reviewed. Finally , we provided some potential future research directions for DFT-based safety and reliability analysis."
