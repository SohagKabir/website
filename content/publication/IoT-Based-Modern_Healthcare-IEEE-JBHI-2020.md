abstract = "The advent of Internet of Things (IoT) has escalated the information sharing among various smart devices by many folds, irrespective of their geographical locations. Recently, applications like e-healthcare monitoring has attracted wide attention from the research community, where both the security and the effectiveness of the system are greatly imperative. However, to the best of our knowledge none of the existing literature can accomplish both these objectives (e.g., existing systems are not secure against physical attacks). This paper addresses the shortcomings in existing IoT-based healthcare system. We propose an enhanced system by introducing a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF)-based authentication scheme and a data driven fault-tolerant decision-making scheme for designing an IoT-based modern healthcare system. Analyses show that our proposed scheme is more secure and efficient than existing systems. Hence, it will be useful in designing an advanced IoT-based healthcare system."
